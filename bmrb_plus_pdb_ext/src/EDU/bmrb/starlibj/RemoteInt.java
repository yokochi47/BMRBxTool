/** This really trivial class exists solely to get around the fact
 * that Java can't pass an int by reference or pointer (only by
 * value).  Java's extremely religious devotion to its "No Pointers
 * Ever!" rule makes us have to do this silly extra work.  (It wouldn't
 * be so bad if the built-in class "Integer" allowed you to alter
 * a value after construction, but it doesn't, so we can't use that as
 * a pass-by-reference.  So any time starlibj needs to pass back an
 * integer as a parameter, it has to use this stupid little class to
 * do it.  Yes, in case you were wondering, I do find this to be
 * rather annoying.  Most of Java is good, but this particular snag
 * is really grating on my nerves.)
