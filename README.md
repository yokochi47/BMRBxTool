# BMRBxTool

The BMRBxTool converts NMR-STAR data into XML format (BMRB/XML). The schema of the BMRB/XML has been translated from the current mmCIF dictionary provided by BMRB (NMR-STAR v3.2.0.15) using “MMCIF Dictionary Suite” provided by RCSB PDB.  BMRBxTool generates qualified XML files by programmed remediation and reports validation errors against the XML schema. By using scripts bundled with the tool, XML files can be updated for both new entries and revised ones.<br />
BMRBxTool uses a modified NMR-STAR dictionary, derived from the original NMR-STAR v3.2.0.15, to pass XML schema validation; the difference between the dictionaries is minimal.
